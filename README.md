# Data-and-Code-
This is my A2 project 
To access this you need to click on the link below. 
Once you have opened the link, a controll device will appear with a game introductory title screen. Click on the (A) button on the right hand side of the controll to start the game.  
The aim of the game is for the Sprite (the dog) to collect as many balls without loosing lives by collecting the tree stick instead. 
To move the sprite utlise the cross controll on the left hand side. Holding down on your computer mouse whilst moving it at the same time, for the sprite to move in what direction you would like it to go to collect the balls. 
Players have 3 lives so make sure you don't collect a tree stick instead. 
Goodluck make sure you are collecting the balls and not the tree sticks don't let the dog get distracted.
